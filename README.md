# Flutter LibRaw

The Flutter LibRaw package aims to provide the ability to read camera RAW files to Dart/Flutter applications. 

This package is a wrapper around the C/C++ LibRaw library using Dart FFI.

Note that this project is still in its early stages and so may not yet provide complete/full functionality. We will be building up functionality over the next few months through numerous small iterative releases.
